# workdayscheduler
I have created a simple application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features both HTML and CSS powered by jQueary. 

The features for this app are as follows: 
* the current day will load as part of the header
* the hours of 9 am - 5 pm will display
* the time markers will change color depending on if they are past, present, or future. 
* you can save your tasks in each individual time slot using the save button 
* your saved tasks will remain in the time slot even after the page reloads
* tasks can be overwritten and re-saved

Here is a link to the deployed site <a> file:///Users/britaniwalley/Desktop/Bootcamp/Homework/workdayscheduler/index.html </a> 

Below is a picture of the application in use:
